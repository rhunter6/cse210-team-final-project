# Final Project - Mine Sweeper
This is a game where using logic and a bit of luck you can clear the board of all of the mines.  Hopefully without getting blown up first!

Left click to dig out a square and expose what is beneath the surface, but be careful because if you dig up a mine it will blow up and you will lose. We have also buried a lot of clues for you to find so if you dig up a number it will let you know exactly how many mines are touching it.

If you are sure, you know where a mine is right click on it once to mark it with a flag, if you are not 100% sure right click twice to make it a question mark, and a third right click will return it to its original value so you can act like you were not even there. 

That is pretty much it.  Once you have dug up every hole that does not have a min in it YOU WIN!


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Arcade 2.1 or newer installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Arcade by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
$ python -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 minesweeper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the minesweeper folder and 
click the "run" icon.

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- minesweeper         (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
